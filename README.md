requires an instance of redis (at least redis 5) running locally.  i haven't had time to set up a dockerfile, but i can concentrate on doing it tomorrow morning.

build with `go build`, and run to see it work.  OR just examine the code.  comments with my thoughts are distributed throughout which are pertinant to my thoughts on it.  would appreciate feedback.
